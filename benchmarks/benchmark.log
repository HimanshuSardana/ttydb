2025-08-08 00:00:31,849 [ERROR] [1] ‚ùå Failed to decode JSON string:  Sure! To find the top 5 highest paid employees from the `Employees` table, you can use a subquery to first determine the highest salaries and then select those employees. Here's how:

1. Find the top salary.
2. Find all employees earning at least that top salary.
3. Limit to the top 5.

This demonstrates filtering on a calculated value.

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM (SELECT name, salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1) AS TopEarners;
```

The inner subquery orders all employees by salary in descending order and takes only one row (the highest). The outer query then selects from this derived table to show the name and salary of these top earners. Note: This specific pattern is common for PostgreSQL, showing a single row with multiple columns extracted. Adjustments might be needed for other SQL dialects.

COUNT(*) as a window function could also be used for the group by clause in some SQL dialects, though standard practice is to count after grouping. (Note: HAVING can replace WHERE in aggregate functions if you want based on group result). If using GROUP BY and then filtering with HAVING for more complex conditions or aggregate results, it's a common pattern. Let's assume 'Employees' table exists. This query groups by department and counts employees, then filters to show only departments with more than 10 employees using `HAVING`. The SQL equivalent of the described condition in the original text (though HAVING is for group result, not direct comparison like `WHERE`). Note: This is a simplified interpretation of 'show departments with more than x employees', as typically `GROUP BY` and then filtering/conditioning on aggregate would be separate steps. For exact translation, context would clarify.
